<p>The use of electronic medical records [EMR] can be the best achievement of IT in sector of healthcare system. EMR system has enhanced efficiency and quality of health care provided to the patients <a href="references.html#watkinson">(Watkinson-Powell & Lee, 2012)</a>. The details that are likely to be omitted in the paper medical records might have significant effect on the plan that health professionals are preparing for the diagnosis of the patient. This grave hazard is avoided by clinical reminders in EMR. So healthcare professionals don’t have to struggle to interpret illegible entries and worry for legible entries to be missed, which has influenced patients’ safety in a positive aspect <a href="references.html#gorman">(Gorman, 2013)</a>. </p>

<p>The shared EMR linkages between the healthcare providers creating centralized patients information allows readily access over the patients’ clinical information no matter from where the patients seek health treatment, thereby rectifying the complications that healthcare professionals have to face in order to get to the medical history of the patients <a href="references.html#singh">(Singh et al., 2008)</a>.</p>

<h3>2.2 E-health</h3>
<p>Next glorious attainment of IT in healthcare system is e-health. It is the distribution or enhancement of health services and information through the Internet and related information and communication technologies, and is an emerging field of not only medical informatics and public health but also business. Internet provides opportunities to disseminate online health services irrespective of gender, age, orientation and location. It is also used for getting appointment with health professionals. Moreover, online health blogs play an important role in providing preventive health education among the consumers <a href="references.html#leiker">(Leiker, 2011).</a></p>
<p>Video below will show more about benefits of E-health:</p>

<h2>3. IT in Medical for education</h2>
<article>
<h3>3.1	In class</h3>
<p>The prominent effective use of multimedia in medicine is to show video clips of interior body, surgical procedures, 2D and 3D animated anatomical structures, user guide to medical machines viz. x-ray, electrocardiogram [ECG], computed tomography [CT] scanner, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and ultrasound machines <a href="references.html#mooney">(Mooney & Bligh, 1997)</a>. Multimedia embedded slides and classes better clarifies the concepts of medical students, enhances understanding and results in improved short term retention <a href="references.html#issa">(Issa et al., 2011)</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>We all know that practicing resources like corpses, real body part, etc., for surgical students is really hard to find which can limit their surgical practices. Fortunately, with ICT, surgical students can practice whenever they need, using the virtual reality surgery. US University Case Western has announced plans to do away with its anatomy labs, and the cadavers that go with them. Aspiring doctors will be able to view the different layers of a body -- skin, muscle, blood vessels, and so on - in 3D <a href="references.html#bestj">(Best J., 2017)</a>. Practicing more means doctors’ level will be improved.</p>
<p>In virtual reality, if the doctors do something wrong, and it will become their lessons, their experience without dead patients. In addition, virtual reality also can be used for the professional surgical doctors. In some difficult operations, the doctors can use virtual reality to test the surgical methods, success rate, and feasibility of these procedures. It does not only increase life rate of patients but also improve doctors’ confidence and level.</p>
